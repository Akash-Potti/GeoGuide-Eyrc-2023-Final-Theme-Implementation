## GeoGuide (GG)
eYRC 2023-24 unveils a groundbreaking solution “Vanguard”, an advanced robotic vehicle, through the theme “GeoGuide”. Guided by the static drone Watchtower, equipped with machine learning algorithms, Vanguard navigates the war-torn arena. Watchtower detects events in real-time, enabling Vanguard to avoid danger zones and adapt to unpredictable alien attacks. With georeferencing techniques, Vanguard understands its position, coordinating with the command centre to strategize against the invaders. Together, Vanguard and Watchtower forge an unbreakable bond, pushing the limits of their capabilities to turn the tide of the war and secure humanity's triumph.

The focus of this theme is to create an autonomous robot capable of navigating an arena using an overhead camera for guidance. The arena is designed to mimic a real-world setting, complete with simulated events and accidents that the robot must successfully avoid. By participating in this theme, students have the opportunity to construct their robot, named "Vanguard," utilising the ESP32 microcontroller. They will delve into the fascinating realms of image processing and machine learning, acquiring valuable skills and knowledge along the way.


## 1. Introduction
Five random events are placed on the arena at 5 positions. Using the overhead camera, the base station has to identify the events and conveys the information to the Vanguard robot. The robot, with the help of its path planning algorithms prepares a path to traverse the arena while following the correct priority as per the rulebook.

## 2. Problem Statement
In this task, the team has to make the robot traverse a suitable path on the arena and enable real-time geo-tracking on QGIS while taking the event distribution on the arena and priority order into account.
